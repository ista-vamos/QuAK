TODO:
	split determinization (also useful for isLive of LimAvg) and livenessComponent


Plan next steps:
    Constant check for nondeterministic limit average -- boundedness stuff [N]
    Safety check for nondeterministic limit average -- implement determinization of safety closure [E]
    Deterministic decompositions [E]
    Decide if we want to distinguish LimInfAvg and LimSupAvg -- relevant for membership
    Membership and monitoring
    DSum?'
    change automata product to build only relevant states
    check all automata methods for optimization (e.g. building a constant automata is not always necessary)
    remove getEdges from class State
