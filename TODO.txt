Check the SCC algorithm N
Decide how to handle sink states -- this is needed for product E
Decide if we want to distinguish LimInfAvg and LimSupAvg -- relevant for membership
Implement inclusion checks N
    (this concludes the basic decision problems for all basic value functions and deterministic limit average)

Plan next steps
    Constant check for nondeterministic limit average -- boundedness stuff N
    Safety check for nondeterministic limit average -- implement determinization of safety closure E
    Decompositions? Deterministic ones may be simple enough E
    Membership? Monitoring?
    DSum?
