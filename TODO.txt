Is Top value of Inf automata done?
Check the SCC algorithm
Decide how to handle sink states -- this is needed for product
Decide if we want to distinguish LimInfAvg and LimSupAvg
Implement boolean inclusion checks (this concludes the basic decision problems for all basic value functions and deterministic limit average)

Plan next steps
    Safety check for nondeterministic limit average
    Constant check for nondeterministic limit average
    DSum?
    Membership?
    Monitoring?
    Decompositions? Deterministic ones may be simple enough
