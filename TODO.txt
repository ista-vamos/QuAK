Check the SCC algorithm [N]
--> SCC v1 only care about the reachable states
--> SCC v2 could care about the unreachable states but does not

Decide how to handle sink states -- this is needed for product [E]

Implement FORQ inclusion checks [N]
(this concludes the basic decision problems for all basic value functions and deterministic limit average)


Plan next steps:
    Constant check for nondeterministic limit average -- boundedness stuff [N]
    Safety check for nondeterministic limit average -- implement determinization of safety closure [E]
    Deterministic decompositions [E]
    Decide if we want to distinguish LimInfAvg and LimSupAvg -- relevant for membership
    Membership and monitoring
    DSum?
