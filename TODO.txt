Is Top value of Inf automata done?
--> yes

Check the SCC algorithm
--> SCC v1 only care about the reachable states
--> SCC v2 could care about the unreachable states but does not

Decide how to handle sink states -- this is needed for product
Decide if we want to distinguish LimInfAvg and LimSupAvg
Implement boolean inclusion checks (this concludes the basic decision problems for all basic value functions and deterministic limit average)
--> This is very hard/longand not a contribution
--> focussing on safety and liveness check is better time investment 


Plan next steps:
    Safety check for nondeterministic limit average
    Constant check for nondeterministic limit average
    DSum?
    Membership?
    Monitoring?
    Decompositions? Deterministic ones may be simple enough
